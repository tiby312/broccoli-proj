### For the reader

In this book I'll go over a bunch of design problems/decisions while developing the [broccoli crate](https://crates.io/crates/broccoli) with performance analysis to back it up. 

The source code for this book is the repo [broccoli](https://github.com/tiby312/broccoli) on github.

### Graphs

The graphs are made uses [poloto](https://github.com/tiby312/poloto) on github.

### Disclaimer

All the benches in the graphs were generated on my laptop which is a quad-core dell linux laptop and all the commentary was made against those graphs. However, you can pull down [github repo](https://github.com/tiby312/broccoli.git) and generate out the benches and this book again to get results specific to your platform. But keep in mind the commentary might not make sense then.
